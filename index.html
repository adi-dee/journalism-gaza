      Over two years after Hamas’ October 7 attack and start of the War in Gaza, Israel’s bombardment has devastated Gaza’s civilians, infrastructure, and cultural life — amounting to genocide.     </p>
    <p class="scroll-paragraph">
      The death toll in Gaza has surpassed 67,000. Only 14 of Gaza’s 36 hospitals remain partially functional, but overwhelmed and under-resourced to treat the over 167,000 injured. Amid a relentless blockade of the Strip, international organizations have confirmed Gazans are living in famine, with over half a million people starving.    </p>
     <p class="scroll-paragraph">
      Throughout the war, Israel barred the entrance of international press. Meanwhile, over 250 Palestinian journalists were killed, making it the deadliest conflict for the press since the Committee to Protect Journalists began collecting data.

      More than 24 hours have passed since Hamas broke out of its Gaza cage, launching an unprecedented attack that caught the Israeli army completely off guard. The infiltration of Palestinian militants across the separation fence, as well as by air and sea — already described as Israel’s most significant intelligence and military failure since the Yom Kippur War of 1973 — has resulted in the deaths of over 700 Israeli citizens from shooting attacks and rocket fire, and the kidnapping of dozens who have been brought to Gaza.

        Since Israel imposed a total blockade on Gaza in early March (which it eased only marginally in late May), we haven’t tasted meat, eggs, or fish. In fact, we’ve gone without nearly 80 percent of the food we used to eat.

        Why is Israel targeting Palestinian journalists in Gaza? Simple. We are the only ones able to document and transmit what is actually happening on the ground. Every image, every testimony, every broadcast we produce pierces through the wall of Israel’s official narrative. That makes us dangerous: by recording the displacement, the starvation, and the relentless bombardment, we expose Israel’s actions to the world.
