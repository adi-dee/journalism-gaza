      For those of us watching from within the besieged Gaza Strip, the situation has been nothing less than terrifying. Shortly after the attack began, Israel declared a state of war, initiating a relentless barrage.

      As the days turned into weeks, the conflict reshaped every aspect of daily life. 
      Families adapted to constant alarms, shelters became extensions of homes, 
      and routines were redefined by uncertainty.

      Neighbors shared food and news, children still found ways to play, 
      and communities leaned on one another to preserve a sense of normalcy.
