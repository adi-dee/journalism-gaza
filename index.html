      Two years on from Hamas’ October 7 attack and the start of Israel’s onslaught on Gaza, the vast majority of the enclave lies in ruins. Israel’s aerial bombardment, ground invasion, and hermetic blockade of the territory, which long predates the latest offensive, have decimated Gaza’s population, its infrastructure, and its social fabric, amounting to <a href="https://www.972mag.com/israelis-logic-gaza-genocide/" target="_blank"">the crime of genocide</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="scroll-paragraph">
      As the Israel military continues to bomb the Strip in what it euphemistically describes as “enforcement” of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire, the official death toll has surpassed 68,000. Multiple <a target="_blank" href="https://www.haaretz.com/gaza/2025-06-26/ty-article-magazine/.highlight/100-000-dead-what-we-know-about-gazas-true-death-toll/00000197-ad6b-d6b3-abf7-edfbb1e20000">recent studies</a> suggest the true figure could be many tens of thousands higher. Hospitals — those that have not been destroyed beyond repair — are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.972mag.com/slow-quiet-death-gaza-hospitals/">struggling to treat</a> the wounded, the hungry, and the sick who survived amid severe shortages of everything from anesthesia to clean water. 
    </p>
     <p class="scroll-paragraph">
      Throughout all of this death and devastation, there has been one constant: the presence of Palestinian journalists on the ground reporting on every massacre, land grab, and war crime. With Israel barring the international media from entering Gaza, these journalists have served as the world’s window into the genocide. Over 250 have <a target="_blank" href="https://www.972mag.com/ismail-al-ghoul-journalist-gaza/">been</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.972mag.com/maryam-abu-daqqa-gaza-journalists/">killed</a>, many of them <a target="_blank" href="https://www.972mag.com/israel-drone-gaza-journalists-forbidden-stories/">directly</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.972mag.com/israel-gaza-journalists-hamas-hasbara/">targeted</a> because of their work, making this the deadliest conflict for the press since the Committee to Protect Journalists began collecting data almost half a century ago.

        For the past two years, +972 has worked closely with a team of freelance reporters inside Gaza who have covered all angles of Israel’s onslaught — from Beit Lahiya in the north to Rafah in the south. Together, they have illuminated what Israel worked hard to keep hidden, while enduring the same immense danger, starvation, repeated displacement, and loss of loved ones as the subjects of their reporting. 
      </p>
      <p >
        Through their writing — a selection of which we have excerpted below, and which can be read in full through the links provided — they have sought to piece together the fragments of life, loss, and resistance that have defined Gaza under Israel’s relentless bombardment. This is the genocide through their eyes.

          Like all Palestinians here, I had received Israel’s messages ordering us to evacuate the northern half of the strip within 24 hours… On Salah al-Din Road — the main highway that runs through the strip from north to south and connects all of its towns — thousands of families were making the same journey. Some were hurrying on foot, carrying whatever belongings they could, and others were riding on large trucks or in their cars.

      For a little over two months, Israel has prevented all food, goods, and medical supplies from entering the Gaza Strip.
      The consequences have been catastrophic: According to Gaza’s Government Media Office, <a target="_blank" href="https://t.me/mediagovps/3605">over 70,000 children are now hospitalized</a>
      with acute malnutrition, and 1.1 million lack the daily minimum nutritional requirements for survival.

        Starving civilians gather in massive crowds, waiting for permission to approach. In many instances, Israeli troops have opened fire on the masses — and even during distribution itself — killing dozens as they try to collect a few kilos of flour or canned goods to bring home in what Palestinians have dubbed &ldquo;The Hunger Games&rdquo;.

        Why is Israel targeting Palestinian journalists in Gaza? Simple. We are the only ones able to document and transmit what is actually happening on the ground. Every image, every testimony, every broadcast we produce pierces through the wall of Israel’s official narrative. That makes us dangerous: by recording the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.972mag.com/gaza-expulsion-aid-delivery/">displacement, the starvation</a>, and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.972mag.com/double-tap-israel-gaza-airstrikes-rescue/">relentless bombardment</a>, we expose Israel’s actions to the world.

        We finally finished construction just three months before October 7, after having lived in the house for more than 20 years. I looked at it with pride: the comfortable home that I promised would provide for my parents as they grew older.      </p>
