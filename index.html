      Over two years after Hamas’ October 7 attack and start of the War in Gaza, Israel’s bombardment has devastated Gaza’s civilians, infrastructure, and cultural life — amounting to genocide.

      The death toll in Gaza has surpassed 67,000. Only 14 of Gaza’s 36 hospitals remain partially functional, but overwhelmed and under-resourced to treat the over 167,000 injured.

      Since the war began, Israel has barred the entrance of international press. Meanwhile, over 250 journalists have been killed by Israeli attacks — making it the deadliest conflict for the press since the Committee to Protect Journalists began collecting data. Despite facing grave danger, forced displacement, going without food or stable internet connection, and mourning the death of their family, friends, and colleagues, our journalists have remained some of the only eyes connecting Gaza to the world. Through their voices, we attempt to reconstruct what has been lost in the over 700 days of this brutal war.     </p>

The infiltration of Palestinian militants across the separation fence, as well as by air and sea — already described as Israel’s most significant intelligence and military failure since the Yom Kippur War of 1973 — has resulted in the deaths of over 700 Israeli citizens from shooting attacks and rocket fire, and the kidnapping of dozens who have been brought to Gaza.

        The military has demolished buildings along the eastern edge of the Gaza Strip, part of what is widely believed to be a plan to establish a kilometer-wide “buffer zone” between populated areas in Gaza and Israel — the equivalent of 16 percent of Gaza’s territory — which Palestinians would be banned from entering.

          Since October, the abandoned Netzarim checkpoint — which the Israeli military operated prior to its “disengagement” from Gaza in 2005 — has been expanded into a 6.5-kilometer-long road bisecting the strip. Satellite images now show the “Netzarim Corridor” stretching from Gaza’s eastern boundary with Israel all the way to the Mediterranean Sea, as well as extensive construction of housing units, communications towers, and other infrastructure.
